#Project Overview:

This project is a 3-tier rule engine application built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It determines user eligibility based on dynamic rules created using attributes like age, department, income, experience, etc. The rules are represented using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which allows for dynamic creation, modification, and evaluation of these rules. The application includes both a backend API to create and evaluate rules and a frontend interface to interact with the rule engine.

#Key Design

1) Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):

Rules are parsed and represented as ASTs to enable flexible and efficient evaluations. Each rule is broken down into nodes representing operators (AND, OR) and operands (conditions like age > 30).
This makes it easy to evaluate complex nested conditions and update or modify the rules dynamically.
Node.js with Express Backend:

2) The backend is built using Node.js and Express to provide a RESTful API for rule creation, combination, modification, and evaluation.
MongoDB is used for storing rule data, including the AST structure and metadata about the rules.
React Frontend:

3) The frontend is developed with React, offering a user-friendly interface for rule creation and evaluation.
Users can create rules by entering conditions, evaluate those rules against user data, and modify existing rules.
Data Storage (MongoDB):

4) MongoDB is chosen for its flexibility in handling JSON-like data, which is well-suited for storing the hierarchical structure of AST nodes.


#Dependencies:

1) Backend Dependencies:
Express: Web framework for building the REST API.
Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool for data modeling and interaction.
Body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before handling them.
2) Frontend Dependencies:
Axios: Used for making HTTP requests to interact with the backend API.
React: Frontend library for building the user interface.


#API Design (Backend):

#POST /api/rules/create:

Description: Create a rule from a string representing conditions.
Input: Rule string (e.g., age > 30 AND department = 'Sales').
Output: JSON response with rule details and AST structure.
POST /api/rules/evaluate:

Description: Evaluate a stored rule against user data (age, department, etc.).
Input: Rule ID and user attributes in JSON format.
Output: Boolean result (true if user meets the rule conditions, false otherwise).
PUT /api/rules/update:

Description: Update an existing rule with a new rule string.
Input: Rule ID and new rule string.
Output: Updated rule details.
POST /api/rules/combine:

Description: Combine multiple rules into one using logical operators (AND/OR).
Input: List of rule IDs and a combining operator (AND or OR).
Output: New combined rule with the resulting AST.




#Frontend Functionality:

#Rule Creation:

A form for users to input a rule string and submit it to the backend for storage.
Example rule: age > 30 AND department = 'Sales'.
Rule Evaluation:

#Instructions for Setting Up and Running the Application:
#Backend Setup:
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd backend
Install backend dependencies:

npm install
Set up MongoDB:

Install MongoDB and ensure it is running on localhost:27017.
You can create a MongoDB database named ruleengine or update the connection string in app.js to match your MongoDB instance.
Run the backend server:

node app.js
Backend will be running on http://localhost:5000.


#Frontend Setup:
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:


npm install
Run the frontend development server:

npm start
Frontend will be running on http://localhost:3000.


#Running the Application:

Create a Rule:

Go to the frontend UI and input a rule like age > 30 AND department = 'Sales'.
Submit the form, and the rule will be stored in MongoDB.
Evaluate a Rule:

Enter a rule ID and provide user data like {"age": 35, "department": "Sales"} to evaluate the rule.
The result will show whether the user meets the rule conditions.
Modify or Combine Rules:

Use the available buttons in the UI to update existing rules or combine multiple rules using AND/OR operators.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to build a rule engine using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with dynamic rule creation and evaluation powered by an AST. The application is flexible, allowing for modification and combination of rules to handle complex user eligibility logic.

This setup can be extended further by adding more features, such as user-defined functions in rules, advanced condition types, or additional validation mechanisms.

A form to evaluate a rule by providing the rule ID and user data (attributes like age, salary, etc.).
Displays whether the user satisfies the conditions of the rule.

#Rule Modification and Combination:

Users can update or combine existing rules with logical operators.
